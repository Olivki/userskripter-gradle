= userskripter-gradle

userskripter gradle plugin for creating single-file distributable userscripts for Kotlin/JS.

For documentation and use case, go to the https://github.com/Olivki/userskripter[userskripter] repository.

Entry point is the `userskript` function, important properties are all documented.

Currently this plugin _only_ works with Kotlin/JS projects, no multiplatform support is currently planned unless a compelling argument for one is given.
