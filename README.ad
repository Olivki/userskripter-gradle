= userskripter-gradle

userskripter gradle plugin for creating single-file distributable userscripts for Kotlin/JS.

For documentation and use case, go to the https://github.com/Olivki/userskripter[userskripter] repository.

Never written a proper Gradle plugin before, so this plugin is probably not written very well.
